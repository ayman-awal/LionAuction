When the user gets to the login page the user will have the option to choose
what type of user they would like to login as; either bidder, seller or
helpDesk.

After inserting username and password the user will land on the appropriate
bidder or seller homepage along with a couple of options such as category browsing,
account information, etc as well as option to switch roles between sellers
and bidders. As a bidder the user will be able to browse through the categories
and check out any products they may like. As a seller the user is able to view
and update account information, view,add,delete listings.

javascript file used to pass the Listing_ID value from the form to one of the routes.
